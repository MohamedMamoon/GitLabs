default:
  image : node:14.19.0-slim	  @ here can i spacific image spesifc to run those stage or scripts
  tags : 
    - mohamed @ here this runner i add before and i install in windows 
workflow: @ this her can i spacific work follow this example it will mean you need to run this all yml file if branch = main , if not = main then skip
  rules:
    - if : $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH != "main" && $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE	!= "merge_request_event" @ $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH this environment variable i bring form docoment of git lab there is more variable you can usse in workflow
      when : never
    - when : always
@ https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/workflow.html
@https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html

variables: # i can identify prameter insdie  yml file also ratherthan gitlab varibla and i use like other variable 
  image_repo : dokcer.io\567161912\
  image_ver : v1.0



stages:            @ those stage to run my stages in order and if one stage fails it will skip the next stage
  - test     @ i can name any thing but execuet it will be in odrder form up to down
  - build
  - deploy

run_unit_tests:  @here i will identifie steps and i will configuer each one at lest have script
  stage: test  @ to spesifc which stage belong this i will add after create stages up 
  before_script:   @ this option with name "before_script" i can include command inside this it will run before script to prepearing env like
    - echo " this prepearing data and connect to spesifc db"            @ this sample of command
    
  script:   @ this section to add all command i need to execuet in this step 
    - npm build 
    - echo "this beging of test"
  after_script:  @ this option with name "after_script" i can run some command after script like remorve empty file or clean some data
    - echo " here to like delete some temp file or clean data or do any thing after run script"
    - echo "also if script fail i can run spacific command here"
artifacts: 
    when: always #here i say always upload those rport if i not add this option just it will upload when seccsesd 
    reports:
       junit : app/junit.xml  # this type of report name junit .. and i spcify where is file 


build_mm :
  Only :   @ we use Only because gitlab-ci-cd if you create any branch it will automatic trigger and run all job inside this file .. if i want to run spacific job like just test i use option Only to spacific which branch it suppose this job to run
    - main
    - newFeature
  stage: build
  needs :            @ this for relationship between steps in one stage if there more than step in one stage and there is dependency between them i can use needs to select which step depend of which step .. 
   - run_unit_tests  @ in this example build_mm depend on run_unit_tests if run_unit_tests fail the build_mm will not start
  script:
    - echo "begin of building app "
    - echo "Tagging the Docker "

push_mm :
  stage : build 
  script:
    - echo "Logging"
    - echo "this micro servises name is  $MICEO_SERV" # i can define customize virable in gitlab and use ans same defind variable up 


deploy_mm:
  stage: deploy
  needs: @ this mean you can't deploy until those two steps finish ok
    - build_mm
    - push_mm
  script :
    - echo "thsi deploy stage"
    - cat $CONF_FILE # also i can mention in environment variable customize is file like key-pair or db configuration file .. first i will add in CICD as variablee and i will add containt in same place then i used
  
  befor_script :
 - chmod 400 $ssh_private_key  @ here we change the mode for key after we add as file in gitlab variable 

script :
  - sshpass -p Dhaid@4321 scp ./docker-compose.yaml ubuntu@Dev_Host:/home/ubuntu @ first we need to copy docker compose file to server we need to deploy
  - docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml down  @ first we will down all container in compose file to lunch new container
  - docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -d  @ here we lunch new container form compose file


 - ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i $ssh_private_key ubuntu@10.0.0.5 "  @ here first option StrictHostKeyChecking this for skip asking to add key and -i mean input and i pass command between ""
    docker login -u $docker_hub_id -p $docker_hub_pass  
    docker run -t -p 3000:3000 $Image_Name:$Image_Tag "

@ we can add docker-compose.yaml file .. this one for add container   
@ befor that we need to install "apt install docker-compose" in server we need to deploy on it to run file 
((
  version: "3.3"  @ version of docker commpose
  services:  @ this mean we will define container
  app: @name of container
    image: ${DC_IMAGE_NAME}:${DC_IMAGE_TAG} @image and tag and we can user our environment variable we use in .gitlab-ci.yml 
    ports:
      - ${DC_APP_PORT}:3000 @we will define port and we can use variable for port putting in browser
))@ we can use docker-commpose file to run docker 
  environment: 
     name: staging  @ this we will define the environment and url to monitor and it will showing under tab deployment > environment it will give full details about this deploy and link to open website app
